# Mock version of Instagram Application using MERN Stack

Insta Clone is a secure social media web app. It resembles Instagram and utilizes React, Node.js, and MongoDB. React's component-based approach and hooks enable efficient state management and reusable UI elements. Redux ensures consistent state modifications, while Context management simplifies data sharing. The back-end, built with Node.js, handles user requests and interacts with MongoDB's document-oriented storage. In summary, Insta Clone replicates Instagram's core features using React, Node.js, MongoDB, Redux, and Context management.
